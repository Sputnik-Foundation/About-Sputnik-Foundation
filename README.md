# About-Sputnik-Foundation
We have an idea, and we want to share it with you

## Sputnik Foundation brings technologies and education for the people who haven't possibility to get technologies by themselves

**The Problem:** <br />
- Many people haven't knowledge and experience in programming and design
- They can't get knowledges and experience by themselves, because they haven't access to computers and Internet

**Solution:** <br />
- Create a space with computers and Internet access, as well as a good psychological environment
- Provide free access for people who want to spend time on self-education
- Maintain gender balance among students (50% female, 50% male)
- Create a reward system for successful self-education
- Teach students to find work on their own
- Promote job search for students who have achieved success in self-education

**The result we expect to get:** <br />
- Integration of students into the field of high technologies
- Turning students into people who will independently help other people to acquire high-tech skills
